# Variable

Exercise 1: Declare and Initialize Variables
Declare a variable named myName using let and initialize it with your name.
Declare a variable named age using var and initialize it with your age.
Declare a variable named isLearning using const and initialize it with true.

Exercise 2: Variable Operations
Create two variables a and b using const and initialize them with 5 and 10 respectively.
Declare another variable sum using let and store the sum of a and b.

Exercise 3: Dynamic Types and Reassignment
Create a variable named unknown using let and set it to 5.
Reassign the value of unknown to "five".
Print the type of unknown using typeof.

Exercise 4 --- Random Number Generator: Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and stores it in a variable. Then, prompt the user to guess the number. Compare the user's guess to the random number and provide feedback (too high, too low, or correct). Repeat until the user guesses correctly.

Exercise 5 ---  Temperature Converter: Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Prompt the user to enter a temperature and the unit they are using (Celsius or Fahrenheit). Convert the temperature to the other unit and display the result.


```

# Condition

Exercise 1: Declare a variable named weather and initialize it with "sunny", "rainy", or "cloudy".
Write an if-elseif-else condition to print appropriate messages based on the value of weather.

Exercise 2: Create two variables username and password.
Write a nested if-else statement:
First, check if username is "admin".
If username is "admin", check if password is "password".
If both are true, print "Logged In".
If the password is incorrect, print "Wrong Password".
If the username is incorrect, print "Wrong Username".

```
Exercise 3 --- BMI Calculator: Create a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. Prompt the user to enter their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and provide feedback based on BMI ranges (underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

Exercise 4 --- Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: Implement a simple rock-paper-scissors game that allows the user to play against the computer. Generate a random choice for the computer, prompt the user for their choice, and determine the winner using conditional statements.
