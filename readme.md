# Variable
Exercise 1: Declare and Initialize Variables
Declare a variable named myName using let and initialize it with your name.
Declare a variable named age using var and initialize it with your age.
Declare a variable named isLearning using const and initialize it with true.

Exercise 2: Variable Operations
Create two variables a and b using const and initialize them with 5 and 10 respectively.
Declare another variable sum using let and store the sum of a and b.

Exercise 3: Dynamic Types and Reassignment
Create a variable named unknown using let and set it to 5.
Reassign the value of unknown to "five".
Print the type of unknown using typeof.

Exercise 4: Area of a Rectangle
Declare two variables, width and height, and assign them values representing the dimensions of a rectangle. 
Calculate and display the area of the rectangle.

Exercise 5: Arithmetic Operations
Declare two variables, firstName and lastName, and assign them with your first name and last name.
Then, declare a variable named myName and assign it the combination of your first name and last name.

Exercise 6: Swap Variable

# Condition
Exercise 1: Declare a variable named weather and initialize it with "sunny", "rainy", or "cloudy".
Write an if-elseif-else condition to print appropriate messages based on the value of weather.

Exercise 2: Create two variables username and password.
Write a nested if-else statement:
First, check if username is "admin".
If username is "admin", check if password is "password".
If both are true, print "Logged In".
If the password is incorrect, print "Wrong Password".
If the username is incorrect, print "Wrong Username".

Exercise 3: Conditional Variables
Create a program that uses conditional statements (if-else) to determine the type of a variable. 
Declare a variable, assign a value (string, number, boolean), 
and use conditional statements to check its type and display a corresponding message.

Exercise 4: Age Checker
Write a program that asks the user for their age. 
Use if and else statements to determine whether the user is a child (0-12 years), 
a teenager (13-19 years), 
an adult (20-59 years), or a senior (60+ years), 
and display an appropriate message.

Exercise 5: Grade Calculator
Create a program that calculates and displays a letter grade based on a numeric score. 
Use if and else if statements to assign the grade according to the following scale:
90-100 => "A"
80-89 => "B"
70-79 => "C"
60-69 => "D"
Below 60 => "F"
